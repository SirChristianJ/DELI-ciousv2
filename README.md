For this capstone, we were tasked with creating a fully Object-Oriented program for a sandwich shop that will allow users to customize sandwiches and order chips and drinks.

I challenged myself to incorporate interfaces and streams as those were the latest concepts we covered in class, and I wanted to demonstrate a clear understanding of those topics. I also wanted to incorporate interfaces to introduce some decoupling of data. Additionally, I implemented an idea I had during my prior capstone: creating a CSV file that holds account information, allowing a user to "log in," verify their account, and make an order under that account. After checkout, a timestamped receipt is created as a CSV file and is then added to a directory named after the current active user's ID.
